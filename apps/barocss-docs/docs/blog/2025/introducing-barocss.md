# Introducing BaroCSS

**By BaroCSS Team • January 15, 2025 • Announcements**

We're excited to announce the release of BaroCSS, a next-generation CSS runtime built for real-time development and AI-driven UI generation.

## What is BaroCSS?

BaroCSS is a revolutionary CSS runtime that brings the power of utility-first CSS to real-time development. Built from the ground up with a completely new parser, it supports the complete Tailwind syntax without requiring build processes, making it perfect for AI-generated UI components and developers who need instant feedback.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Generation**: CSS generated instantly without build processes
- **Full Syntax Support**: Complete Tailwind syntax support in the browser
- **AI-Ready Architecture**: Perfect for AI-generated UI components
- **Zero Build Time**: Eliminate compilation delays completely
- **Intelligent Parsing**: Advanced incremental parsing with smart caching
- **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive APIs

## Why BaroCSS?

While there are many CSS frameworks available, BaroCSS was created with a focus on:

1. **Developer Experience**: Intuitive class names and comprehensive documentation
2. **Performance**: Minimal CSS output and fast build times
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to customize and extend for any project
4. **Modern Standards**: Built with modern CSS features and best practices

## Getting Started

Getting started with BaroCSS is simple:

```bash
npm install @barocss/kit

```

Or use it via CDN:
