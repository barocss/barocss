## 🚨 Risk Management

### Potential Release Blockers
1. **Animation System Complexity**
   - *Risk*: CSS animations don't map perfectly to Figma
   - *Mitigation*: Focus on supported features, document limitations
   - *Contingency*: Release with basic transitions first

2. **AI Integration Delays**
   - *Risk*: Anthropic API integration issues
   - *Mitigation*: Implement mock suggestions for development
   - *Contingency*: Release AI features in v0.2.1 patch

3. **Component Library Scope**
   - *Risk*: Too ambitious component set
   - *Mitigation*: Focus on 3 core components minimum
   - *Contingency*: Additional components in v0.2.1

### Release Rollback Plan
```bash
# If critical issues found post-release
npm deprecate cssma@0.2.0 "Critical bug found, use 0.1.6"
git revert <release-commit>
# Hotfix and release 0.2.1
```
