# Introduction to BaroCSS

BaroCSS is a **CSS runtime** that brings the power of utility-first CSS to real-time development. We've built a new parser from the ground up to support the full Tailwind syntax in the browser, eliminating build processes while maintaining all the performance benefits of JIT compilation.

## What is BaroCSS?

BaroCSS is a CSS runtime designed for real-time development. It supports the complete Tailwind syntax without requiring build processes, making it perfect for AI-generated UI components and developers who need instant feedback.

## Key Features

### ‚ö° Runtime-First Architecture
Built from the ground up for real-time CSS generation with advanced parsing capabilities. Experience the power of utility-first CSS without build processes.

### üéØ Real-time JIT Compilation
Just-In-Time compilation happens instantly in the browser. Only the CSS classes you actually use are generated, resulting in minimal bundle sizes and optimal performance.

### ü§ñ AI-Ready Architecture
Designed for AI-driven development. When AI generates Tailwind-based UI components, BaroCSS ensures they render instantly without any build steps.

### üß† Intelligent Parsing
Advanced incremental parsing with smart caching, DOM change detection, and optimized performance for real-time development.

### üîß TypeScript Support
Full TypeScript support with autocomplete, error checking, and type safety throughout the development process.

### üåê Production Ready
Runtime that scales from development to production with consistent performance and reliability.
