Add animation patterns and interaction examples to README

- Add comprehensive "Animation Patterns" section with real-world examples
- Document interactive button animations with hover states
- Include loading state patterns (spinner, pulse, bounce)
- Add micro-interaction examples for cards and form feedback
- Provide TypeScript examples for common animation use cases
- Enhance developer experience with practical animation implementations

These patterns help developers implement smooth animations and transitions using CSSMA's animation system with Tailwind-style classes.
