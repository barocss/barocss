# @barocss/cad-interop

This private workspace package turns BaroCSS CAD `PreviewPacket v0` data into
renderer buffers or a self-contained glTF 2.0 binary file (`.glb`). It has no
runtime dependency on CAD, GPU, Three.js, Babylon.js, or Pixi3D. The preview
packet is shared by `@barocss/cad` and `@barocss/gpu`.

## From CAD to a GLB

```js
import { tessellateSurface } from '@barocss/cad';
import { encodeCadPreviewGlb } from '@barocss/cad-interop';

const { packet, report } = tessellateSurface(surface, {
  countU: 16, countV: 16, revision: 1,
});
const glb = encodeCadPreviewGlb(packet); // ArrayBuffer
// In Node.js: writeFileSync('part.glb', new Uint8Array(glb));
```

Pass an array of 1..32 packets to put several surfaces in one GLB. Their
`surfaceId` values must be unique. Each surface becomes a separate mesh and node.

The CAD engine also emits `barocss-native-face-mesh` for native face previews.
Pass that result to the separate entry point:

```js
import { tessellateOwnPlateCircularHole } from '@barocss/cad';
import { encodeOwnNativeFaceMeshGlb, prepareOwnNativeFaceMesh } from '@barocss/cad-interop';

const { mesh: nativeMesh } = tessellateOwnPlateCircularHole(bundle, { context });
const prepared = prepareOwnNativeFaceMesh(nativeMesh, 'plate_display', 3);
const glb = encodeOwnNativeFaceMeshGlb(nativeMesh, 'plate_display', 3);
// prepared.packet is compatible with the shared CAD/GPU preview packet.
```

This path rotates CAD `part-xyz` into right-handed Y-up coordinates with
`(x, y, z) → (x, z, -y)`. The GLB node's `extras.barocss` keeps the result
context and each face's native ID, token, orientation, normal source, and
vertex/index ranges. These ranges identify display triangles. They do not
define native CAD edges or topology.

The output uses glTF's right-handed, Y-up coordinates and **metres**. CAD packet
positions in millimetres are multiplied by `0.001`. Normals and triangle order
are retained. The material is double-sided because CAD previews may be open
surfaces. Each node keeps `surfaceId`, `revision`, source unit, and the preview
marker in `extras.barocss`. Native CAD U/V parameters are stored in the custom
`_CAD_UV` vertex attribute. They are not texture coordinates. A target loader
may ignore that custom attribute.

## Load in a renderer

Three.js can parse the returned bytes directly:

```js
import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/addons/loaders/GLTFLoader.js';

const gltf = await new GLTFLoader().parseAsync(glb, '');
scene.add(gltf.scene);
```

For Babylon.js, serve the GLB as `part.glb` and use its glTF loader:

```js
import { LoadAssetContainerAsync } from '@babylonjs/core/Loading/sceneLoader';
import '@babylonjs/loaders/glTF/2.0';

const container = await LoadAssetContainerAsync('/part.glb', scene);
container.addAllToScene();
```

Pixi3D's glTF loader can load the same served `part.glb` asset. PixiJS itself
is a 2D renderer; use a 3D extension or another glTF-capable engine to draw it.
Follow the loader API for the Pixi3D/PixiJS version in your application.

For an engine without a glTF loader, use owned typed arrays:

```js
import { prepareCadPreviewMesh } from '@barocss/cad-interop';

const { positions, normals, indices, parameters } =
  prepareCadPreviewMesh(packet, 0.001); // scene units per millimetre
// Upload the arrays to your renderer. `parameters` are native CAD U/V values.
```

The scale argument is required for direct buffers. The package does not choose
a camera, light, shader, or renderer state.

## Scope and verification

The input is the existing JSON-compatible `PreviewPacket v0`. Validation checks
the schema, array sizes, finite values, exact bounds, normals, triangle indices,
winding, and Float32 conversion before output. It rejects unsupported versions
and malformed meshes. Outputs own their data. Arbitrary JavaScript Proxy traps
are outside this data boundary.

The GLB contains a **tessellated display preview**. It does not contain the
original NURBS, CAD feature graph, B-Rep, or IGES data. Keep the native CAD
model for later editing or exact exchange.

Run `pnpm --filter @barocss/cad-interop test` for packet, GLB, and Three.js
checks. Run `pnpm --filter @barocss/cad-interop test:integration` for real
CAD surface and native face mesh → GPU packet → GLB → Three.js paths. A generated GLB also passed the
Khronos glTF Validator with no errors or warnings in the local integration
check. Babylon.js and Pixi3D loading are documented from their loader contracts;
they have not been run in this repository.

This package remains private and experimental. Before publishing to npm, assign
a release version, remove `private`, and run the package and consumer checks
against the exact release artifact.
