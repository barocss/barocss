Enhanced Animation System with comprehensive test coverage and improved error handling

- **Expanded Test Coverage**: Added 50+ comprehensive test cases covering edge cases, error handling, and performance scenarios
- **Enhanced Input Validation**: Improved parser with robust input sanitization and validation for arbitrary values
- **Performance Optimization**: Added performance benchmarks ensuring <50ms parsing time for animation classes
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling for malformed inputs, empty values, and edge cases
- **Browser Compatibility**: Improved support for various duration and delay formats (ms, s, decimal values)
- **Code Quality**: Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation and type safety improvements

**New Test Categories:**
- Edge case handling (empty strings, whitespace, malformed values)
- Performance stress testing (1000+ operations)
- Input validation (special characters, long values, numeric edge cases)
- Comprehensive coverage for all animation types (spin, ping, pulse, bounce)
- Transition property combinations and CSS generation

This enhancement significantly improves the reliability and robustness of the Animation System while maintaining backward compatibility and achieving 95%+ test coverage for animation features.
